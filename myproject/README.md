## What the app does

The user enters data in the required fields on the `DATA ENTRY` tab using the `SUBMIT` button, the app then directs the user to the `VIEW DATA` tab. The `VIEW DATA` shows the automatically plotted graph and data table which is produced from an automatically created SQL database. To enter additional data the user must then go back to the `DATA ENTRY` tab. The user has the option to add and delete annotations to the plot using the `ADD ANNOTATION` and `DELETE ANNOTATION` buttons, the `CLEAR` button clears the SQL data base.
